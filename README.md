# Recipe Suggestion Web App

## üìñ Overview
This project is a user-friendly web application designed to suggest recipes based on the contents of a user's fridge. Users can either upload an image of their fridge or input a list of ingredients, and the app will provide recipe suggestions and cooking instructions.

---

## üåü Features
- **Image Recognition:** Automatically identifies ingredients from uploaded images.
- **Recipe Suggestions:** Generates personalized recipes based on provided ingredients.
- **Multi-language Support:** Accessible to a diverse user base with multi-language capabilities.
- **Error Handling:** Clear error messages for user inputs and system errors.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
### 1. **Web Application**
   - Built using Streamlit, integrating both frontend and backend in one application.
   - Users can upload images or input ingredient lists directly.

### 2. **Image Recognition Component**
   - Processes uploaded images to identify ingredients.
   - Utilizes TensorFlow Lite for on-device recognition or Google Cloud Vision API for cloud-based services.

### 3. **Recipe Suggestion Component**
   - Leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 API for generating advanced and personalized recipes.

### 4. **API Integration Layer**
   - Handles communication between the app and external APIs for image recognition and language processing.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Guidelines
### Code Standards
- **Variables & Functions:** Use `snake_case`.
- **Classes:** Use `PascalCase`.
- **Constants:** Use `ALL_UPPERCASE`.

### Testing
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage.
- Use `pytest` for unit testing.
- Include detailed documentation for each test.

### Modularity
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Ensure decoupled components for easy maintenance.

### Logging & Error Handling
- Log key events using Python‚Äôs `logging` module.
- Provide clear error messages for debugging and user feedback.
---
## üåê Accessibility
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive navigation.
- **Error Messages:** Meaningful guidance for incorrect inputs.
- **Integration Challenges:** Efforts to mitigate dependency issues on external APIs.
---
## üöÄ Known Challenges
1. **Integration Challenges:** Combining various APIs and technologies.
2. **API Rate Limits:** Usage constraints of external APIs like GPT-4 and Google Cloud Vision.
3. **Learning Curve:** Proficiency in new tools may require time.
4. **Dependency on External Services:** Risk if APIs experience downtime or changes.
---
## üí° Future Enhancements
- **Offline Mode:** Incorporate offline image recognition using TensorFlow Lite.
- **Expanded Recipe Database:** Add a custom database for more diverse suggestions.
- **User Preferences:** Tailor recipes based on dietary restrictions or cuisine preferences.

# Unit testing

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recipe-generator.git
cd recipe-generator
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up your OpenAI API key:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

## Running Tests

The project includes a comprehensive test suite using pytest. To run the tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run specific test file
pytest test_recipe_generator.py


```

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for full system flow
- Parametrized tests for various input scenarios
- Mock tests for external API calls

### Current Test Status

All tests are currently passing. The test suite covers:
